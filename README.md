# 👋 Hey there, I'm Emmanuel Nzekwue

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Business Analyst turned Data Scientist** with a background in **Information Science (B.Sc.)** and an **MBA in Data Analytics**. I specialize in **data storytelling**, **predictive modeling**, and **building tools that drive smarter decisions**.

With experience across **e-commerce**, **insurance**, and **consulting**, I’ve worn many hats—from mapping out business processes to deploying machine learning models in **Streamlit**.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🔍 **Business & Data Analysis**  
  Transforming operational data into strategies that work. I use tools like **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **SQL** to drive process improvements and deliver insights that matter.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Projects**  
  I design and deploy **predictive models** for classification, regression, and segmentation problems using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **XGBoost**, then bring them to life with **Streamlit** for real-time decision support.

- 📊 **Dashboard Development**  
  I create **interactive dashboards** and visualizations to make complex data understandable—especially for stakeholders and non-technical audiences.

- 🔁 **Change Management**  
  Helping businesses navigate and implement meaningful change using analytics, documentation, and stakeholder engagement strategies.
